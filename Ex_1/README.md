# Exercise 1

In this exercise I set up a virtual environments `cf-python-base` and `cf-python-copy`, and created a `requirements.txt` file. 

Within this folder is a starter `.py` file that takes two user-inputted variables and returns the sum of them, as well as the screenshots of the setup proccess in the terminal.
