# Python Exercise 2

## Step 1: 

I chose to use a dictionary as the structure for the recipes as they will all contain multiple objects of different data types, and all data inside the dictionaries will be accessible to the user, which is helpful is user wants to modify a recipe in some way. Key:value pairs will be helpful for orgianizing and visualizing the data.

## Step 3: 

I chose to use a list to store all of the recipe dictionary objects, as this will allow the user to store, view, add and modify recipes easily in this structure. (See Step 5 screenshot for example of this)
