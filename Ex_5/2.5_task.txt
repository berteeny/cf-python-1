1. I have added a pic attribute to each recipe, along witha  default image if the user chooses not to add an image.
Otherwise everything has stayed the same as the last iteration, as it works well functionally. Migrations have been completed.
2. I have added five records to the database via the admin portal
3. https://recipesage.com/#/welcome
    i like this app becasue its homepage is welcoming and it shows a preview of what the view looks like when logged in so you can see before you make an account
